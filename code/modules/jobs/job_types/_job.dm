	If you want to change a job on a specific map with this system, you will want to go onto that job datum

	changed_maps = list("OmegaStation")

	Then, you're going to want to make a proc called "OmegaStationChanges" on the job, which will be the one
	actually making the changes, like so:

	/datum/job/miner/proc/OmegaStationChanges()

	If you want to remove the job from said map, you will return TRUE in the proc, otherwise you can make
	whatever changes to the job datum you need to make. For example, say we want to make it so 2 wardens spawn
	on OmegaStation, we'd do the following:

	/datum/job/warden
		changed_maps = list("OmegaStation")
